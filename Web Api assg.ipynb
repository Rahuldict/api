    "An API is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. It defines the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information, services, or functionalities from each other. APIs enable developers to access the functionality of existing software components or services without having to understand their internal workings.\n",

    "A common real-life example of an API is the Google Maps API. This API allows developers to integrate Google Maps' features and functionalities into their own applications.
